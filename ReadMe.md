## Features ✨

- 🖥️ Intuitive visual keyboard layout editor
- 🔧 Firmware configuration tool
- 🎨 Customizable keycap designs and legends
- 📱 Responsive design works on desktop and mobile
- ⚡ Fast performance with Rust
- 🎮 Supports both ANSI and ISO layouts
- 🔌 Compatible with popular keyboard firmware formats

## Goals 🎯

I wanted to modernize existing keyboard tools while learning Rust and web development. This project combines:

1. **Layout Editing** functionality from [Keyboard Layout Editor](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com)
2. **Firmware Building** from [KBFirmware](https://kbfirmware.com)

All built with modern technologies that ensure longevity and performance.

## Technology Stack 🛠️

- **Rust** - For core logic and performance
- **Dioxus** - React-like framework for building user interfaces
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **WASM** - For browser-based execution
