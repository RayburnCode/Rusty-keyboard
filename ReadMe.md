# Rusty keyboard Editor

A Rust + Dioxus + TailwindCSS keyboard Layout and Firmware Editor.

## Goal

Was learning to solder by building a custom mechanical keyboard and using these two tools listed below and noticed they havent been updated in a while. Decided to update with some modern tools, and try my hand at combining into a more easy to use platform.

## Inspiration

Inspired by:

1. Leyboard Layour Editor by Ian Prest
